# Integrative Team Project

**Project description:**
The network setup includes a networked Building Management Smart Meter System, a server and a few laptops. The project comprises 4 stages: 1) Analyzing the network for exploitable vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities should focus on those specific to the Smart Meter network at SIT@NYP level 7 and, on a lower priority, the IT network at SIT@NYP level 6 (COTIS). 2) Developing and testing the exploits of the set of discovered vulnerabilities from stage 1. 3) Developing a dashboard to launch successfully tested exploits from stage 2. Final demos must be captured on clips with explanation. 4) Monitor exploitation outcomes and propose suitable remediations for these vulnerabilities. Document these in your report.
